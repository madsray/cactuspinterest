# cactuspinterest
who doesn't love pinterest? And I love cactus!
# Approach
I wanted to create a full stack application that combined my love for cactus and website that I visit everyday (Pinterest). I use a one to many models to add the comments for each picture and sub indexes to create the multiple dimension.
# Technologies
-Node.js, Express, EJS and partials
-MongoDB and Mongoose
-Css and Bootstrap
# What can you do on this site?
-Users are directed to a page full of categories and the option to add a cactus idea.
-Once the user picks a category they can view tons of posts for that categorie and click on each picture to see more details about that particular idea. They can then add comments and delete comments and edit them.
# Modifications
-In the future, I would like to add some javascript to allow users to be able to add new categories and have it wear capitalization wouldn't matter and multiple categories couldn't be created.
-I would also like to clean up the show and edit pages.
-Another thought would have the cactus pots on the edit and new pages fall to the bottom when the pages loads
-in general, I would just like to add more categories to my bag!
# Images
I do not own any of the images. I found them on verious websites for free!
